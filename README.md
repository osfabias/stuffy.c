## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.16 or higher
- C17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Git (for cloning)

### Basic Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:osfabias/stuffy.c.git
cd stuffy.c

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make
```

### Build with Specific Options

```bash
# Build with all features enabled
cmake -DSTUFFY_BUILD_SHARED=ON -DSTUFFY_BUILD_EXAMPLE=ON -DSTUFFY_BUILD_TESTS=ON ..

# Build in Release mode
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

## Build Options

The project supports several CMake options to customize the build:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` | `Debug` | Build type: `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `MinSizeRel` |
| `STUFFY_BUILD_SHARED` | `OFF` | Build library as a shared library instead of static |
| `STUFFY_BUILD_EXAMPLE` | `ON` (standalone) | Build example program demonstrating library usage |
| `STUFFY_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` (standalone) | Build test programs |

### Build Type Details

- **Debug**: Includes debug symbols, no optimization, enables `__STUFFY_DEBUG__` macro
- **Release**: Optimized for performance, no debug symbols
- **RelWithDebInfo**: Optimized with debug symbols
- **MinSizeRel**: Optimized for minimal size

### Compiler-Specific Features

- **GCC/Clang**: Uses `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` with additional warnings
- **MSVC**: Uses `/W4` for high warning level
- **All**: Position-independent code enabled, C17 standard enforced

## Using as a CMake Subdirectory

To use this library in your own CMake project:

```cmake
# Add the library as a subdirectory
add_subdirectory(stuffy)

# Link the library to your target
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE stuffy)
```

The library will be built as a static library by default. To use as a shared library:

```cmake
set(STUFFY_BUILD_SHARED ON)
add_subdirectory(stuffy)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE stuffy)
```
